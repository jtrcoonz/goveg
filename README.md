My partner and I are vegan and we really wanted an easier way to find recipes that fit that diet. It's easy to find vegan restaurants but it's more difficult to find diverse vegan recipes without buying a bunch of different cookbooks or visiting a bunch of different websites.  This API hack allowed me to find complex information about recipes that could be utilized as queries to refine searches that fit people's specific dietary needs all in one application. It's healthy eating, simplified!
